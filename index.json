My research focuses on the use of differential geometry and control theory to achieve planning and control of robot manipulators that can simultaneously travel with constant speed and achieve the pre-assigned orientation along a spatial curve. I had internships with Flexiv robotics and Honda Research Institute. My motion and force control strategies have been tested and employed by Lockheed Martin via collaboration with the ARM. I have received the TAMU MEEN scholarship, research excellence fellowship, and the AFS scholarship.\nI have been actively involved with robot motion control for 4.5 years. My involvement with robot control requires the domain knowledge of linear/nonlinear/adaptive control, numerical optimal control (direct method). I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with velocity-actuated, torque-actuated, and kinematically redundant robot manipulators. The manipulators I had experience with are UR5, UR10e, UR16e, ABB4600, KUKA IIWA, Panda, Flexiv Rizon. My expected graduation is May 2022, and I\u0026rsquo;m open to robotics control engineer/research scientist/system analyst.

Our approach in developing the robot path through the waypoints relies on the orthogonal collocation method where the states are represented with Legendre polynomials in the Barycentric form; the transcription process efficiently converts the continuous-time formulation of the optimal control problem into a discrete non-linear program. In addition, we provide an efficient method for avoiding robot self-collisions (of joints and links) and collisions with workspace obstacles by modeling them as the union of spheres and cylinders in the workspace. The resulting collision-free optimal trajectory provides smooth and constrained motion for the robot passing through all the waypoints in the given prescribed sequence with a constant speed.\nDemo The proposed work has been accepted to IROS 2021 and conditionally accepted by T-ASE.

The laser sensor is treated as an additional link, and based on it a novel perception system is developed for real-time scanning of the surface that provides the surface profile mesh and the corresponding normal vectors which can be used directly by the robot closed-loop control system for pose tracking. A unique feature of the perception system is that the geometry of the surface profile and normal vectors are all obtained in real-time in the robot base coordinate system, thus eliminating issues such as precise registration of the work piece in the fixture and its location with respect to the robot base coordinates. An impedance-type closed-loop control algorithm is developed for pose tracking. The proposed system and control algorithm are employed to conduct surface finishing experiments on wooden surfaces. A representative sample of the results and measurement images of surface finish are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the robotic surface finishing system\nDemo The demo can be found here demo video\n","date":1639699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639699200,"objectID":"da65c3f116228ee55ae67feea1b79148","permalink":"https://ywen27G.github.io/academic_demo/project/example/icra/","publishdate":"2021-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic_demo/project/example/icra/","section":"project","summary":"Prototype robotic surface finishing system","tags":["Pose Control"],"title":"Surface scanning and sanding with UR5","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Objectives The objective is to control the manipulator to move along a spatial curve that simultaneously achieves constant speed (norm of velocity) of travel and maintains the pre-assigned orientation. The proposed work applies to (1) dexterous manipulation without contact; (2) contact-based operation such as surface finishing. Part of the reason for its difficulty is that the speed and position of the robot end-effector are coupled, and it is not easy to travel along the curve with a constant speed. In addition, the proposed work aims to reduce the tracking error that grows in proportion to the speed. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we further apply the proposed method to perform surface finishing that achieves the following three objectives simultaneously:\n (1) The robot tool frame origin converges exponentially to the curve; (2) The robot tool frame moves with constant speed to remove a uniform layer of material; (3) The robot tool frame (one of its direction cosines) tracks the orientation of the surface normal vector field. So the robot can regulate the contact force in the surface normal direction, and this makes sure that the robot can move in the tangential direction.  Demo The demo can be found here: demo video.
